**Hi there! 👋**  
Welcome to my GitHub profile.  

I am a multilingual professional with 6 years of experience in digital publishing, who recently transitioned into full-stack web development after completing an intensive bootcamp at Le Wagon Paris.

I combine editorial expertise with solid technical skills and a collaborative mindset. Passionate about continuous learning and problem-solving, I am eager to join a team where I can grow as a developer and contribute to building impactful digital products.
