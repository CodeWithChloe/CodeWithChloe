**Hi there! ðŸ‘‹** 
Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a multilingual professional with 6 years of experience in digital publishing, recently transitioned into full-stack web development after completing an intensive bootcamp at Le Wagon Paris.

I combine editorial know-how with solid technical skills and a collaborative mindset. Passionate about learning and problem-solving, I'm looking to join a team where I can grow as a developer and contribute to building meaningful digital products.
