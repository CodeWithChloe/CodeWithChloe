Hi, welcome on my GitHub profile! My name is Chlo√©. I am a multilingual professional with six years of experience in digital publishing. I recently transitioned into full-stack Web development through an intensive bootcamp at Le Wagon Paris, blending editorial expertise with technical skills and cross-functional collaboration. 

I am eager to leverage my strong communication skills, constant drive for learning, and solution-oriented approach in a Full-Stack Developer role. Looking forward to joining a team where I can grow and build impactful digital solutions.
